# streamlit-live-chart
This rep show how to display live charts on a dashboard implemented using Streamlit. User don't have to refresh the page everytime to see the changes. That will happen automatically. 

# What is special about it?
- calls html file from streamlit
- live charts that updates every 1000ms, to avoid refreshing the page everytime
- uses RESTapi and jason requests
- Charts retrieve data from json text
- I am using Sankey Chart, you can adapt it to any other chart
